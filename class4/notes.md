### Notes
- In JS, numbers occupy 64 bits.
- For/in is for iterating in object properties
- For/of is loops through the values of an iterable object
- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
- Variables defined with `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared
- JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
- In JavaScript, a prototype is a mechanism that enables objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
